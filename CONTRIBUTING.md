# Contribution Guideline

First of all, I want to thank you, a help is always appreciated in this type of projet ^^

Here you will find all the process that you need in order to give an hand on this project.

## I. If you find a bug ?

Verify first the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible like code sample or a test case reproducing the case.

## II. Did you write a patch that fixes a bug ?

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

Before submitting, please read the wiki page which describe the rules for coding in the application in order to respect them in your correction.

## III. Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch ?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability generally not be accepted.

Except if the project is in a period of refactoring and beautify the code.

## IV. Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one ?

Suggest your change in the discussions section by creating a new one with the "Idea" category.

Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

## V. Do you have questions about the source code ?

You can ask any question in the discussion section of the repos by creating a new one with the "Questions" category

Thanks for all!
